Great products feel effortless because the hard work stays behind the scenes. Here are three decisions that make a UI feel calm:

1. **Reduce competing focal points.** Lead with one clear action.
2. **Keep color restrained.** Use a single accent with deliberate contrast.
3. **Match motion to intent.** Let transitions reinforce hierarchy.

The goal is not to remove personality. It is to focus it.
